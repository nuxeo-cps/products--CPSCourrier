Tabular Widgets
===============

The purpose of tabular widgets is to list elements, for example search
results or folder contents. They share a common rendering system,
defined in base class widgets.tabular.TabularWidget. The lookup of
items to display depends on the widget type. They can be used in
portlets as well as in ordinary documents.

The row layout
--------------

Property: row_layout

The rendering makes use of an auxiliairy layout, that will work on
each item being listed to render the rows. Each widget in this layout
will produce a column in the table.

For technical reasons, the row layout must be actually organized as a
column: one cell per line. It will be nevertheless rendered as a row.

The row layout can be flexible, in which
case it will be associated to the portlet or document object on which
the tabular widget depends. Reminder: flexible layouts/schemas are
associated to the CPSDocument instance (and actually stored within it
in the current implementation).

Actions
-------

If the 'actions_category' property is filled, the widget will render
the actions of this category available for the object for which it is
called, for example as form buttons.

Empty listings
--------------

If there is no element to list, the widget will render as the string
provided by property 'empty_message'


The rendering method
--------------------

Like with many widgets, the final rendering is delegated to a rendering method,
most likely a page template. This method is passed the following
arguments:

:mode: the widget's mode
:columns: a list of tuples made of

          #. the widget that was used to render the column. Its properties can
	     then serve as global column info. For instance, the label can be
	     used for column headings.
  	  #. a boolean telling whether the column is currently used as the
	     sorting reference.
	  #. the sorting mode (currently '' and 'reversed')
  	  #. the GET part of url to trigger sort or toggle sorting
	     mode (including '?')

:rows: the list of rendered rows
:actions: the list of actions associated to the document the tabular
	  widget was called for. This is a triple (title, url, id)
:here_url: the url of the proxy the tabular widget was called for.

In case the rendering method isn't supplied by subclass or property,
the rendered rows are sequentially dumped.

Workflow Stack Widget
=====================

Not used anymore in CPSCourrier implementation.

This is a simple widget to call stack renders from within a layout.
The workflow variable holding the stack is declared in the property
'stack_var_id'. What the widget does is:

- fetch the stack
- call the stack's render method with the requested mode and additional keywords

This widget is intended mostly to be used in 'view', although any mode
(even bogus ones) are currently forwarded to the stack.
