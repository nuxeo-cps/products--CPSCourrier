CPS Workflow Stack Widget
=========================

This is a simple widget to call stack renders from within a layout.
The workflow variable holding the stack is declared in the property
'stack_var_id'. What the widget does is:

- fetch the stack
- call the stack's render method with the requested mode and additional keywords

This widget is intended mostly to be used in 'view', although any mode
(even bogus ones) are currently forwarded to the stack.
